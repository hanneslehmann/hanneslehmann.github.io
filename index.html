        Continous Integration BW5.12/Jenkins - Part I
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Dec 3, 2014</span>

    


    

<p>First some pre-requisites.</p>

<p>The workflow of a Continous Integration with BW would be (GIT is used in this case, same thing can be done with SVN or other source control tools as well):</p>

<p>Developer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tibco Designer &mdash;-&gt; create &amp; save &mdash;-&gt; Project</li>
<li>Project &mdash; push to repo &mdash; &gt; GIT</li>
</ul>

<p>Jenkins:</p>

<ul>
<li>GIT &mdash; clone project locally to&mdash;&gt; project_dir</li>
<li>buildear &mdash; create deployment artifact to &mdash;&gt; project_dir/app.ear</li>
<li>AppManage &mdash; extract config from ear into &mdash;&gt;  project_dir/app_config.xml</li>
<li>Script (Ant, bash,..) &mdash; modify configs within &mdash;&gt; project_dir/app_config.xml</li>
<li>AppManage &mdash; combine ear and configs &mdash;&gt; deploy to BW domain</li>
<li>GIT? &mdash;&gt; commit/push deployment artifacts together with config</li>
</ul>

<p>The Jenkins job can be run manually, scheduled or, if configured correctly, with the source control system, on every check-in/push.</p>

<p>This article covers only a really abstraced view on the process, which can grow to complexity. Only some random thoughts what has to be clearly defined before setting up CI (without beeing complete):</p>

<ul>
<li>The CLI tool chain from TIBCO is needed on the same box, where the applications are build (either on a Jenkins bot, or some remote scripting&hellip;), how can this be achieved (Licences..?)</li>
<li>Build strategy: how is the branching/staging done? So, we need to tell Jenkins what to check out from where/when (on every build?) Manually if new branches are created?</li>
<li>The target environment: how many staging boxes are there (Dev, Test, UAT, Prod)? Should the build be done automatically on which ones? Is there access from Jenkins (or it&rsquo;s bots to all the needed machines?)</li>
<li>Any quality assurance before deployment? Source code checks (e.g. naming conventions, comments,&hellip;), automated testing?</li>
<li>What happens in a case of failure? What would be the way to recover a (former) working version of the application?</li>
<li>How can new jobs be added to Jenkins? Any Administrator/Ops Team? Automated?</li>
<li>Any automated reports needed?</li>
</ul>

<p>Following steps have been done on a Windows Box (AWS Windows Server 2012).</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Jenkins installation</h2>

<ol>
<li>Go to Jenkins Homepage: <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">http://jenkins-ci.org/</a></li>
<li>Download Windows Package / Unzip and start &gt;setup.exe&lt;</li>
<li>Choose the installation directory. After setup is completed (on my box) a browser pops up, showing Jenkins waiting for jobs.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/jenkinstibco/win1.jpg" alt="Installation of Jenkins on Windows completed" title="Jenkins on Windows" />
</p>

<p>If you need to change the port of Jenkins standard configuration, it can be changed by editing the jenkins.xml file (change <strong>httpPort=8080</strong>) which is located in the installation directory (choosen during installation).</p>

<p><img src="/jenkinstibco/win2.png" alt="Config file" title="Jenkins config on Windows" />
</p>

<p>This was my original config - useful to increase heapsize etc:</p>

<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;service&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;jenkins&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Jenkins&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;This service runs Jenkins continuous integration system.&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;env name=&quot;JENKINS_HOME&quot; value=&quot;%BASE%&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;!--
    if you'd like to run Jenkins with a specific version of Java, specify a full path to java.exe.
    The following value assumes that you have java in your PATH.
  --&gt;
  &lt;executable&gt;%BASE%\jre\bin\java&lt;/executable&gt;
  &lt;arguments&gt;-Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle -jar &quot;%BASE%\jenkins.war&quot; --httpPort=8080&lt;/arguments&gt;
  &lt;!--
    interactive flag causes the empty black Java window to be displayed.
    I'm still debugging this.
  &lt;interactive /&gt;
  --&gt;
  &lt;logmode&gt;rotate&lt;/logmode&gt;

  &lt;onfailure action=&quot;restart&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After applying any change, restart the Jenkins Service using e.g. the Windows Task Manager. For this article I changed the Jenkins Port to 6060.</p>

<p>For more details (e.g. issues or advanced config, such as installing jenkins as a slave, check out: <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+as+a+Windows+service">the jenkins wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Preparation of BW5.12 scripted deployment</h2>

<p>Within TIBCO BusinessWorks 5.12 ear-files (deployable artifact) are created via the TIBCO Utility/Script BuildEar. The deployment is done via the AppManage Utility. Both are available after installation of BW TRA.</p>

<p>The AppManage utility must be run on a machine that is part of the administration domain you are updating.</p>

<p>Example manual steps for deploying an application:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">AppManage -deploy -ear D:\jenkins\ears\deployment\helloworld_service2.ear -deployconfig D:\jenkins\ears\deployment\hello_service-bw5_dev.xml -cred D:\jenkins\cred.txt -app TestServices/hello-service -domain bw5_dev
</code></pre>

<p>In this case we would deploy &amp; start a service within the TestServices folder. The AppManage Tool is located in the <strong>tra</strong> folder of your installation (e.g. C:\tibco\tra\5.9\bin).</p>

<p>The ear file can be created automatically via the build tool:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">buildear.exe -s -ear /helloworld_service.archive -o D:\jenkins\ears\deployment\helloworld_service2.ear -p C:\Users\Bob\Documents\bw5\helloworld_service
</code></pre>

<p>Options:</p>

<ul>
<li>ear) takes the name of the project archive file, don&rsquo;t forget the leading slasch!</li>
<li>o) is the ouptut directory</li>
<li>p) is the directory of the project (where the archive file is located)</li>
</ul>

<p>The buildear is located in the same directory as the AppManage Tool.
For more specific explanations check the Tibco Documentation!</p>

<p>Before deploying, as mentioned before, the config file has to be created (by AppManage) and adjusted to the target environment where the deployment will happen (usually a clever script).</p>

<p>Export the config of an existing ear.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">AppManage -export -ear  D:\jenkins\ears\deployment\helloworld_service2.ear -out D:\jenkins\ears\deployment\helloworld_service2.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Or, in any case following command can be useful to export a current config from the Admin. It helps to understand what has to be changed inside the config file (when you are setting up things the first time)&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">AppManage -export -app TestServices/helloworld_service -out D:/jenkins/helloworld_service.xml -domain bw5_dev -cred D:\jenkins\cred.txt
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Next steps will include</p>

<ul>
<li>Jenkins/Git Integration</li>
<li>automated checkout by Jekins</li>
<li>automated deployment by Jekins</li>
</ul>

        Customer experience management
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Nov 27, 2014</span>

    


    <p>It seems that we are back to the future: 2015 will be the year where discussions about Customer Experience Management will gain even more speed. A lot of companies are trying to push tools out to the space.
They adress challenges of our new and modern world:</p>

<p>30 years ago, there were small local shops (in Germany so called &ldquo;Tante Emma Laden&rdquo;), they knew you as a customer and most of the time even your needs. They knew even your family and possibly have seen you growing and growing to an adult.</p>

<p>So, when you stepped in once a week, they were already prepared with your usual shopping list&hellip;and when it was sommer - they put some sun blocker on top. Possibly they remembered you&rsquo;ve broken your sun glasses last sommer, asking you if you want to buy one. On the other days, they already prepared you the right news-paper. And when it was week-end, it was time for your favorite &ldquo;Croissant&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Nowadays this intense relationship to the customer got lost - and what do you do? You try to collect as much data as possible to gain insights of the customer: the feelings, the (actual) needs and even predictions what she/he might need in the future.</p>

<p>Tibco is placing the <a href="http://www.tibco.com/company/news/releases/2014/tibco-announces-its-new-marketing-application-built-to-optimize-consumer-engagement?adbsc=social_engage__20140910_31264846">Engage Platform</a> into the bet.</p>

        Kickstart BW5.12 Project
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Nov 24, 2014</span>

    


    

<h2 id="toc_0">Kickstart BW5.12 Project</h2>

<p>I have created the a small make file to speed up BusinessWorks Designer Project creation. Additionally it creates some sub-directories which helps keeping the project structure clean.</p>

<p>I will possibly update the make file, so be sure to subscribe to the git repo!</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">make project='somename' 
</code></pre>

<p>Here comes the make file (can be found in my GitHub repository). It takes an existing bw project stored in a (hidden) directory under <em>.template</em> and copies it to the target project name. It then replaces the name in some files and creates some additional sub-directories.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># Makefile 
# Created to speed up initialization of a TIBCO BW 5.12 project
# by Hannes Lehmann
#

PROJ=${project}
PROJDIR=
DESIGNER_BASE=/data/tibco/designer/5.9

run:    
ifdef PROJ
	@echo Creating skeleton for a new project called: $(project)
	@mkdir -p ${project}/Schemas 
	@mkdir -p ${project}/Processes
	@mkdir -p ${project}/Services
	@mkdir -p ${project}/Resources  
	@cp -R .template/* $(PROJ)
	@sed -i 's/1template1/${project}/g' ${project}/vcrepo.dat
	@sed -i 's/1template1/${project}/g' ${project}/defaultVars/defaultVars.substvar
else
	@echo Nothing done, try to pass an argument project=
endif

launch:
	cd $(DESIGNER_BASE)/bin/ &amp;&amp; $(DESIGNER_BASE)/bin/designer $(CURDIR)/$(PROJ)
	cd $(DIR)
</code></pre>

<p>What I do with this script is: run it for creating a new BW project. Before you can use it, either you:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a project called &lsquo;1template1&rsquo; and change the directory to &lsquo;.template&rsquo;</li>
<li>clone the git repo.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually I will add additional functionality to the script (possibly remove the dependency on the template project).</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Best Practice for BW project structure</h2>

<p>Create some folder insider your project collecting/grouping functions together. For example the Makefile above will create following directories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Schemas (for XSDs, WSDLs, etc.)</li>
<li>Processes (put your bw processes here)</li>
<li>Services (if any WebServices are created, collect them here)</li>
<li>Resources (any http, jdbc or whatever else is needed)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is only a recommendation and a really flat hierarchy. Avoid to create to many folders/subdirs as it should still be usable (remember: some OSses/Systems don&rsquo;t like really long path names).</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Nov 20, 2014</span>

    


    

<h2 id="toc_0">Markdown for documenting</h2>

<p>I have created the first small bash script to help ease my Markdown workflow.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">whatchme.sh file.md 'grep &quot;^#&quot; file.md' 
</code></pre>

<p>Here comes the script (can be found in my GitHub repository for cloning/forking as well!). I found most of it in a forum, thanks to that guys!</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash
# Script by Hannes Lehmann
# Use it, when you need it

if (( $# &lt; 2 )); then
    echo &quot;Not enough arguments passed to whatchme!&quot;
    echo &quot;Provide the filename as first argument,&quot;
    echo &quot;and the command to be executed as second argument.&quot;
    echo &quot;example: whatchme.sh file.md 'grep something file.md'&quot;
    exit 1
fi

while true    
do
   ATIME=`stat -c %Z $1`

   if [[ &quot;$ATIME&quot; != &quot;$LTIME&quot; ]]
   then    
	clear
       	eval $2
       	LTIME=$ATIME
   fi
   sleep 1
done 
</code></pre>

<p>What I do with this script is: run it in a separate / parallel shell to my editor (where I am editing the current markdown document) to have a fast overview of the chapters and their structure.</p>

<p>The next day I will enhance the script with automated chapter numbering to increase the structural view.</p>
